# Covid_SQL_Project
The purpose of this project was to practice manipulating data in referene to COVID-19. After extracting various tables to reference from SQL queries, I created a visual dashboard in Tableau to showcase the amount of COVID cases and deaths various countries/continents have reported from 2020-2023.
